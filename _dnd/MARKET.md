## General Notes

You may *sell* used or looted items back to the market for half price.

Items styled with emphasis (e.g. *Candle*) are considered *Non-Encumbering* items for encumbrance purposes, although the Referee can rule that quantities of the items do count towards encumbrance. Items styled with double emphasis (e.g. **Barrel**) are considered to be *Oversized*.
