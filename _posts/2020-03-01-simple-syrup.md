title: Building an SSH Honeypot
---

I want to find the cool malware.

How could I do this?

I could download some from theZoo, but then I'd be getting bugs that exist on Github. Finding them in the wild would be much cooler.

So then, I need a honeypot. But I don't want to use one that's already made, I want to build my own, so I know exactly what it does.

I built one. I built it in Go, because I like Go. It's pretty jank. It probably wouldn't capture the coolest malware. But for now, it will do.
